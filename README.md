This project was kickstarted with the Gatsby hello-world boilerplate. Using some hacky SCSS.

## 🚀 Running Locally

0. **Pre requiste tools/tech**

   - Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
   - Install Gatsby-CLI. [Official Docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/)

1. **Clone the repo.**

   Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

   ```shell
   # clone this repo
   git clone https://github.com/RahulTandon1/ams-site.git

   cd ./ams-site

   gatsby develop

   ```

   You'll the site running at `http://localhost:8000`!

1. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

   ```shell
   cd my-hello-world-starter/
   gatsby develop
   ```

1. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

   Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

> Please note I have note I not updated this for any custom files used in this project. What follow below are the ones in the Gastby hello-world starter.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning React or Gatsby

If you've never React or Gatsby but have some basic HTML, CSS, JS experience most of the code in this repo will seem _sort of_ familiar but kinda of 'wrong.'

- You'll need know **ES6 Syntax** to understand React. Youtube, Scrimba both have a plenty of tutorials. I watched a tutorial on [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com) and [Mosh Hamdeani's video on ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCwa_xi0Uuc&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh).
- Next you can quickly dive into React. You'll need to know basics of state, prop, lifting state etc. I watched [Mosh's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh) and did the [official getting started tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) for revision.
- Now you're reading for Gatsby! I learnt most of what I know from [Andrew Mead's Great Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM&ab_channel=AndrewMead) (Youtube video)

I can't promise these'll work for you. I was able to gaine enough to build this website for AMS.

If stuff doesn't make sense Google and official documentation are the saviours.
