            <p>
            We work with the differently-abled students with a motto: “Every Child Can Learn.”
            A set up for 62 students, we provide various rehabilitation services to the students and coalesce with local government hospitals to
            provide the required medical interventions. We also promote inclusion among mainstream
            schools by conducting training sessions for their teachers and in-house remedial sessions.
