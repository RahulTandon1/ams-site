                    Our speech and language pathologist helps students overcome their speech, l
                    anguage and communication challenges. They use several methodologies to help the students plan, 
                    coordinate and produce sound. In the early intervention section the emphasis is on creating the 
                    right environment for speech stimulation, increasing the receptive language vocabulary and encouraging 
                    the correct sound productions.

                        For older students with motor-speech and motor-planning difficulties, a holistic approach is 
                        followed. Along with the physical aspects of speech production, factors like cognitive levels 
                        and social environment are kept in mind. A multisensory approach using tactile, kinesthetic, 
                        visual and verbal cues are used to work on their misarticulations, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic language
